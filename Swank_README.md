**Lab Assignment 5**
#Ally Swank

In this lab, I cloned a github repository in my command line to work collaboratively with Ocho Loco. 

By dividing out roles, we collectively input a simple sequence file and ran the reverse compliment of that sequence. 
After editing files, we used git commands (pull, commit, and push) to update the repository on github, which allowed everyone to see our changes as we went.
