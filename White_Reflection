Reflect on how you currently manage your documents and code, particularly content associated with publishable work. Would it stand up to a reproducibility test? How do you think non-reproducibile research affects computational biology and bioinformatics? What about in your specific field of study?

I do not use coding in my lab work yet, so I will discuss how I use it in class and how I hope to use it in my future career. All of my coding in this class on a virtual machine. Each Lab Assignment in given a directory under my Home directory. Every file that needs to be used in or is related to the project is placed into that directory. Recenly I've been implementing version control, adding file.#.sh.  , where the # represent s the version number. When I begin coding for my research project I will use these same methods and upload the different version to github or a similar site. This will help keep me in-line and show exactly where my mistakes are.
I think a published work that cannot be reproduced in some way needs to be reevaluated. Perhaps compare it to other studies and see where and why the discrepancies arise. I plan on going into Genetics, which is heavily dependent on bioinformatics. I think having openly published code will help determine if a study is truly reproducible or if the different evaluation methods were used. If the work is not reproduced, then I would know that I needed to go back and look over the code and see where I may have programed something in a way that does not reflect the methods.
