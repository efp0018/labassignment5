Reflect on how you currently manage your documents and code, particularly content associated with publishable work. Would it stand up to a reproducibility test? How do you think non-reproducibile research affects computational biology and bioinformatics? What about in your specific field of study

I currently use very little code or technical documentation with my publication work. However some of the analysis could benefit from increased reproducibility. 
Non-reproducible research in computational biology can lead to misleading publications and information whcih the public and researchers both can run with. 
If code is not available and well documented, it is difficult to reproduce results or understand exactly how they were obtained. 
With my field, molecular biology, this can be an issue with obtaining particularly tricky results if methods are not well documented and reagents are not shared.
